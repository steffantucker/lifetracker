# Life Tracker
## What it is
Life Tracker allows you to easily track what you did and when. The home page displays simplified view and allows you to quickly start a new actions. Other pages allow you to view past actions (eventually on a graph of some sort), add activities you can start actions with, and a settings page to change the date format, default actitivy for action.

## MVC
At a minimum, the application will have the ability to start, stop, edit, and delete actions and activities. The user will also be able to view, edit, and delete past actions. 

## Future
- color associated with activity.
- filter past actions by date/activity
- search support
- graph/pie view of the day, color coded according to activity
